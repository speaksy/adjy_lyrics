I "...And not a day later that makeshift post line
tied would deliver oft....

"June Awake!"

"... It's only eight..."

"Come on you waif!"

"...And that morning
They'd crawl from their bunks to a campsite
among an ocean of sun-baked rows of corn...

To:

2 Green wide plains, dusty white rock roads,
wiry low weeds grow bristled like a bonny's tou-
sled hair.

Her salt-skin jig upon the summertide of Illinois
-sweat and amber scent through the balmy open
air.

3 The bright proud sun through the tent top
towns
-Manic light yells down and everything around
yew bows!

An ash tree shrouds hot skin -wet from the creek
where the sky meets the ground now to baptize
the week in humidity.

4 Such a humble place for the birth of the world!
...a supply store church, a congregation of corn
a dandelion psalm; among clover and chicory
Grazing hands while they stand -a secret-tongue
accrete."


5 A gnomon-mound-Cahokia-finger to the wind
the shadow in its wake
is the line behind a pen...
The contrast on the paper rightly metes our
"when" and "where"
go now carry boy the compass,
she brought along the square!

6 Draw a bound
around Tiamat's sea!

"A summer crown...
A Pirate King!"

"...among the berry
lay his Queen!"

7 Come realign all history! ...come Holler Anno Domini!
All moments lead to here, and....
"... all futures flow from now!

8 "Could it be?"
"Do you see?"
9 Align loadstar!

10 "A sprig of time."
Byzantine!
"On Troubadour!"
