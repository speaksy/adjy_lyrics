II "Meru bound, A civil mare all let free as they
dance in the agora for a flicker jamboree.

12 Those little-light-flies environ where they
collide around the Yggdrasil a'sprout.
Over the gate to peek inside

13 Queen Anne's Lace, dusty white rock roads,
wiry low weeds grow bristled like a bonny's tou-

balmy open air.

And on that evening -somewhere behind it all

an Original Line was tied..."
