

8 ...I'm falling away...
I'm stuck in the lea
And that Part of you still
flows within me.

9 You're everywhere I go
you ring in my ear...
10 You're there in their call
They leave every year...

II With our callow claim
With our manic must;
Gone Gilgamesh,
Gone Romulus,
Gone lonely Cain
...all safe in his home...

...The Temple became
a colosseum...

12 ...Now they only emerge
Every 17 years
For eden they dirge
For what used to be here...

And everything wails
A few months a year
Awoke in the night
For a lover thought near



13 It used to be here

It used to be here

It used to be here...


14 I want to share it all!
I want to bare my skin!
I want to be poured out!
I want to go back in!

I want to share it all!



It used to be here....

15 I'm falling in love.
I've fallen in love
...I'm falling away.




...It used to be here...
