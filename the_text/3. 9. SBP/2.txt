
I I see it all
The years flutter by...
we race in that store
to the end of our lives

2 above so below
We leapt and we dove
and panting we chase
what we almost know...


3 Be it courage or must,
my hand pioneers
In the front of the bus
where yours would endear.

4... now they only emerge
every 17 years
For Eden they dirge...
...For what used to be here...

5 Now Everything's roused
a few months a year
Awoke in the night
For a lover thought near

Will a Summer like this ever come again?

O ...I've spent years trying to find my way back in...


6...You're everywhere I go
In every line I see
I feel you in the lake
I hear you in the trees

The years in the wind
The lives in their call
I want to go back in...

I want to share it all


7 I want to feel the press
The Wrestle and run
Of force of my force;
in our native tongue.

I wanna share it all!

I'm falling in Love...
