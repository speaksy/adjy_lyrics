Where June Meets July:
VI
The Cicada's Song part I






I "Come Lace my hand to yours
there's something I want to show you..."

Lake-skin in firework ore, warm sweat incense...

"I see you wreath wet in fireflies
...come barefoot through the weeds with me."

2 "...I found this by the campfire light:"

3 "Cicada nymphal instar!
I've never seen one alive before..."

4 "Well this is one of their shells...
but follow me...

5 ...You know, they only sing here
Once every seventeen years...

6 ...What are you?!"

"Me?! ...What could you be?!"

"...I guess... I've just...
I've never really met anyone before...

...You're the First..."


7 O can it be... right here.... With me ...A shell awake?
I'm gonna burn alive!
O how I've longed to -with you- wrestle dearly.
A Shell awake!
A Flame arise!
