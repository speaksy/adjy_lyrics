Off all their soaked clothes so
what's real can fly ...and be known"

"But this shell is something more though...

9 ...For long after summer's breath expires
...it's A note ...we can hold in our hands...


A shell..."
"...a wake
An Ache..."
"...a song..."
"...A wait so long...."

"...a moment to burn alive!"

"O how I long to -with you- wrestle dearly."

A Shell awake...
A Mystery...

II The Parochet...
How can it be?


12 "...But, we're breathing aren't we now
Come sing!"

13 Hair dripping lake down your frame
under your lace soft thistling anoints your skin;

Blessed all wet in the weeds.
All burning deep in toil
Setting fire to everything

14 "A Green that feels no shame
no need for cover'n
shoutin' out roused 'cause you're near!"

...everything now bends round here.

15 "O come I long
To with you wrestle dearly
Blessed all wet in the weeds
settin' fire to everything.

16 A shell
awake
An ache
A song
A wait so long
A moment to burn alive
O how I long to -with you- wrestle dearly;
A shell awake
A flame arise!"
