Part II

Becoming aware of himself, he sought a friend.
-Epic of Gilgamesh

1 "Are you there
Solstice day that might never end?
Are you there
Summer nights that endlessly begins?
2 How I've longed under the lined oaks on that street
to not hold back.
3 I wanna be what I was meant to be...

4 ...to be in those backyards
...With a match lit.
5 If I run with my whole heart
Can you catch it?
6 Singing, "Wonder will be the only order we'll see!"
...in bottle rocket smoke.

O tomorrow's gonna be something!

7 Grass green -Our skin still wet with chlorine
8 That "Sweet Smell" lingers on
as the night breathes:
9 "I'll always be the child who fell in love."
We'll swear and sway
as the street lights guide us...

...Through this neighborhood ...O we own it.
10 Singin, "we don't care at all!" as we break in
To a record number ...
11 and on 101 ...the sirens cheered us on...
A good "why" dares any "how!"
...and I can't bow to "how it is"
when I need what it means!

12 Ring the Bell
on a day that might never end,
13 And Meet me there
on summer nights that endlessly begin...
14 How I long,
won't you come with a kiss and a key
15 No holding back!
16 We will be what we were meant to be.

17 ...and It sneaks up every year
but this time I'll hold it right.
...right past what we know.

18 ...Oh tomorrow's gonna be something!"
