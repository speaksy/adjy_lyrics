salty smoke...

18 ...She'd take him in where John of Lieges sens-
es dulled -where "He of Sedge and Bee" pretends
his honey comes from a dead bull."


19 "You tried to dress me up...
present me at a ball...
but my "savage manor" made 'em gibe and jeer
in snickered protocol.
20 My parent taught me to
befriend the lowly and the weak,
But that sycophantic lot plots I ought
earn the favor of their elite?!
21 He said long ago: "Boyo,
may freedom burn in you a reckless wral!"
that part of me won't ever change,
or make it's home
inside of shame or wall!

22 Vassal fame; decorating leashes;
Slaves enslave in a mana-bread and circus!

23 Born unto a stage
they hone the cadence of a joke
...but don't know why they're laughing.
Their "god of Noble Lie:"
vox populi, fears sovereign eyes
... but how can Love burn where fire's frightening?





24 For a plot of land you'd clip your claws
-feign civil pedigree, file down your teeth...
...The "Queen of Open Wood,"
pride-of-the-pack, danced manic moon?

25 ...Now you beg for treats, and beg to speak
in portrait seats in public ballyhoo?
26 Panopticon-domesticated... Paint the locks?
Let fame of state-and-title shave your mane?


27 ...but I can't hide my claws!"
