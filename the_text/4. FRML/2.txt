I "There are two pillars pied...that hiked a trail
of appellations back ...where June now stood one
foot on the grass and one on the tarmac..."


2 "Come let us sow our dowered soil,
draw harrowed audience!"

3"...they crowd only by force of vote
...And force is violence..."

4 They just want shelter;
some have never known a home..."

5 "But to even learn
you must endager
what you already "know."

6 "Look... when I'm inside those wuthered heights,
I must play the part,
7 But when you hear me speak as them,
don't lose hear;

8 ...Just a while, until we earn our own keep!"

"They guard the way..."

"but soon we'll hold every key!

9...O They laud your pen!"

"...til when it threatens just how they pay the bills...

10 When "truth's" not common cause
all "dialogue" ...it's just a war of wills.

Remus-Wounded-Knee on Apalachee loam..."

12 "...To fawn amens,
Annona render
-with fealty unto state...?"

"...They'll vest us Aegis
'tis how love may age us grey!

Toe the line.
...and with fingers crossed kiss the ring?
Feign a bow...
...and at night we'll howl proudly!"


13 "But they're like crabs around our feet
who think us weak when we don't trade in sand...

14 their eyes aren't real in their sight
unless the light of many eyes holds them exalted.

15 No guards here tend the locks
-th lot of self regulates-
16 renown's a treat they gain in curating their cage..."
