





O tremble all you mountains
at what is in your midst!

"...A pen to draw the shapeless!"

"A breath to shape the pen!"

"...And with you will be my home."

"...With you I am present."

"...With you I can express."

O thou art beautiful,
O my Love, as Tirzah!











"...Can you fence life in
when life like wind
is the movement made
not the air moving?"



"...Can you know the wind
unless you cup your hand
and for a moment
hold a part of it?"
