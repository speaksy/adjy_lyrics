I O Come, I long to with you wrestle dearly...
A Flame
Arise
Bound in these fleeting lines
Awake a time
thrashing wildly
To shake and climb
And for a moment burn: Alive

2 O Come you Flame in the Fiery name of Life
Come set A seal on my heart
wrapped in the fervid bliss of strife


"O come quick! Look! There up on that tree!"


...where for the first time in all of history...


....There is something else...
