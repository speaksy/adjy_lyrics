awake,
an ache,
a song!
...Await so long for this moment to come!

A flame arise!
Come quick it's time!
awake!
a climb...
On to find an echo back!




4 O bless my soul
I've never seen
Such wonder glow
Oh what a Mystery

A pulse
A pant
A tryst
A dance

They're just like you

...Breaking out so they'll get caught...
