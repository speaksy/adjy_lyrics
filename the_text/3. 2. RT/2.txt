I "In the heat of the late morning sun, June
packed for the road with his band; they'd drive
toward the Midwestern verge for the Midsummer Dithyramb.

...Though what blew in that day would ever the

9 "Onward to the Land of Lincoln!
Set camp upon the eve of gala!"

10 "That night outside..."

"...I Couldn't hear a word in there...."

"she points up:"



"you know the dipper's

"...Teasing he plays like he already knew.
They both break laughing 'cause she saw right
