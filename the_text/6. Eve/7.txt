I Must I eyes rent wide wake here every time
To a life I must remind myself is mine..
2...Can you hide your head in that bed you use
From the howling dreams of the life we knew...?

3 You can fool them all... can you fool the night
As you're drawn in your doorway by the porch light?
4 Should you Drifting Go down your parents blood.
Know that river's flow will become the flood.

5 ...while off somewhere off in some other time
O we just met in that great collide...

6 ...Only there we're free and we make a home


"A Summer Peach with her Corn field Groom."


7 ...There's a Tree that still stands in that park
On whose limb rests our covenant ark.
8 There's a word that should we speak again...
A crucifixion breath must we draw back in.




9 "A shell awake!"
10... An ache,
"...a song..."

II "O Comely as Jerusalem..."

12 "A shell Await...
13 ...a Flame arise!"


14 On an endless loop
til we get this right...


Can you hide your head in that bed you chose
when your wild heart knocks at the door you closed?



15 "...lay your head on my shoulder;
we have done wrong.
Though we wont last the evening
we'll have til dawn."
