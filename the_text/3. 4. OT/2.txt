We burn every fetter down.
O tonight
Raise a banner
We face the chance of "now."
Tonight...
don't slow your pace just 'cause swine step over pearls.
We face the chance of now
... O tonight."




5 "....So ...why the stage
If you abominate that 'city act?'"

"O I like fiction ....'til it's sold as 'fact.'

6 ...guess all ever wanted
is to feel like someone's looking back.
Thought... if only I could say it right...
...they'd understand...

7 O Tonight
We burn every fetter down!
O tonight
Raise a banner!
We face the chance of now!
O Tonight!"

8 "To reach, writhing
out from your heart with a pen...."

"...and have the hue of the ink
all that they review...

...they only hear words that they already say.
I'm never gonna fit within that world they've made..."


"But:
... O a lion raised alone by sheep or shrew
Wouldn't know
what its own teeth could do!"
