Part I

I "At the edge of all doors opend at summer the
whole world waits there warm and in wonder... as
they bull and bray on that last school day

-and there was no time but now...

2 ...To a wild-eyed young man restless to be. Had
a dream..."
"Wake... late!"
"'Trouble.' Never fit within their frames...

An incurable love soaked all he could see in the
heat hopped the fence, splashed the friends cal-
low crowin':"
"They'll never own our burning!"

"A naked reflection hit the lake with a toast:"
"Don't ever trust an order

...nights would burn alive by the light of a pool
in a watermelon age of eager could-be-blooms. it
was a feast of endless sun-blessed afternoons!

...and there were giants in the land in those days...

... and anything at all could happen!"

"A humid embrace,
and A verdant enthrall:
A tender cicada call.

A new daisy wreath,
gown of wild oat plume,
a wet clay and corn perfume!"

4 "Nervous and eager everyone would be there...
Out there it was endless... but he couldn't bring
it in..."

"Someday they're gonna see it, every trap I will upend!
Aw, tonight it's my turn!
I am gonnna swim warm in this skin!

5 ...Though Everything's astir
to find an other of its kind
In this season drenched in purpose
...I've no partner for my crimes..."
