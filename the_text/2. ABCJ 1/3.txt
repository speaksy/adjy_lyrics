6 "The lake drawn through a reed he called; a
song, a band, and pen and with freedom still wet
on his lips he rang:"

"A humid embrace,
and a verdant enthrall,
a tender cicada call,

A new daisy wreath,
gown of goldenrod shoots
a wet clay and corn perfume...

7 We are blessed to be chosen
to run forward as reality's vanguard
-glowing deathly alive!

... on that evening by the river
Come and dance like there's no place but here
Say I've been set apart from all else!

8 ...I am wild come from wild
-an adopted feral child...
"I was made to run ablaze, not hold back!
9 For I am menace! I am frenzy!
10 Pour that big 'ole dipper out
'cause there's no quelling the fiery tongue upon this brow!
11 O sing on cicada!
May your tymbals ever drum through all green halls!
-come timber run un-belayed!

12 Help me sing it right by midnight...
raise a fist to every star with eyes!"

...For wyrds spin idle
cut from compass rose...
