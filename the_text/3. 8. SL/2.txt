I "Can I stay here?
Can I stay in this moment?
Wet clay on our feet...
If this is life
O may it never cease."
Stay here!
Just stay in this moment!

"We are seeds of the same tree..."

I can feel you breathing through the leaves...


2 "...I want to show you a Mystery too:
But June, you have to promise me...
that you'll keep it
a secret
-I've never told anyone about this before:"

cel wrapped in ancient weathered cloth like a
relic from some long forgotten time..."

there... bathed in sunlit particulate
...I found something incredible..."

"A Book?"

What's inside became the world to me

...That's why I need that city, June
Fate has made this tale a part of me
And I a part of it...

but without their help I can't see it through

The way it ought to be..."


"A Hecate gate, A Hermes sign, A Hestian womb...
Letoides... Touched the seed round her neck
sighing:"

"Out's now what we're not in."
