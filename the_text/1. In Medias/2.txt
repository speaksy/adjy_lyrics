1 Wait! Hold! Wait... tighter! Eyes closed, era; hour.
Weak-weight; shy moment
-Quick hold it!

2 wait hold. wait, runner. Don't go cold Summer.
Day, week, hour, Era
-Quick hold it!

3 Somewhere in between
what it was and was to me...
There is a line I cannot find
For it's ever drawn behind...

"Where two forms ever debut... The Cloverleaf
four rivers run through."

5 ... On A page in their purlieu...

6 "The Lightning bug below them flew ...Their
Candles lit IN sacrAment; ... holy riTe!"

Now holy wrIt...

"...An Open field..."

a brokeN star:

"It's who they were..."

It's who they were...

...It's who we were...

...It's who we are...

7 "Wait -hold -wait, tighter! Eyes closed, era;
hour. Weak-weight; shy moment
-Quick hold it!

8 Wake -hold -wait, runner. Don't go cold Sum-
mer. Day, week, our era;
Quick hold it!

9 Wait, hold, wait, tighter, Eyes closed, -eyes
Don't know it! Week... wait! Shy moment
-Quick hold it!"

10 Out lay the years like dandelions
I transmute as lead for golden wine
-the dog days stayed in sigil casks;
when I take a dram, it takes me back...

11 I scry their tale to quicken mine
And for a moment you're alive...
... but when I blink, I'm bound in skin
A lonely ram... a peerless twin...

12 ...I panic swill -eyes clinched I wind...

13 ...Further back... a Mystery...
In Josh's house, you came to me...
...in my room I wept alone
-at the story of my Home...

14 ... for you're all I've known of kin
-born in the midst in requiem!
15 ...And it all comes down to you...
A bonny echo I once knew...
